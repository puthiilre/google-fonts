What you will need:
 
- A computer with Photoshop installed
- A scanner or a camera to capture some magazine and newspaper clippings
- A Burn Book font template (you can download one from [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/market/mean_girls_burn_book_font) or use the [Mystery Mixed](https://www.dafont.com/forum/read/467069/mean-girls-font) or [Ransom](https://www.dafont.com/forum/read/467069/mean-girls-font) fonts from Dafont.com)

Step 1: Scan or take pictures of some magazine and newspaper clippings that have different fonts, colors and sizes. You can use any type of text, but try to find some that are bold, italic, or have interesting shapes. Save them as JPG or PNG files on your computer.
 
Step 2: Open Photoshop and create a new document with the size and resolution you want for your Burn Book font. For example, we will use a 600 x 600 pixels document with 72 dpi resolution.
 
Step 3: Open the Burn Book font template you downloaded or chose from Dafont.com and drag it to your Photoshop document. Resize it to fit your document and place it on a new layer. You can use the Free Transform tool (Ctrl+T) to rotate, scale or skew the template as you like.
 
Step 4: Select the Magic Wand tool (W) and click on one of the letters in the template to select it. Then go to Select > Inverse (Shift+Ctrl+I) to select everything except the letter. Press Delete to remove the background around the letter. Repeat this process for each letter in the template until you have only the letters on a transparent background.
 
Step 5: Open one of the magazine or newspaper clippings you scanned or took pictures of and drag it to your Photoshop document. Place it on a new layer below the template layer. Use the Free Transform tool (Ctrl+T) to resize and position it over one of the letters in the template. You can also use the Warp tool (Edit > Transform > Warp) to adjust the shape of the clipping to match the letter.
 
Step 6: Select both the clipping layer and the template layer and press Ctrl+E to merge them into one layer. Then use the Eraser tool (E) to erase any excess parts of the clipping that go beyond the letter. You can also use the Burn tool (O) or the Dodge tool (O) to darken or lighten some areas of the letter to create more contrast and depth.
 
Step 7: Repeat steps 5 and 6 for each letter in the template using different magazine or newspaper clippings until you have created your own Burn Book font. You can also add some effects like drop shadows, strokes or gradients to make your font more realistic and eye-catching.
 
Step 8: Save your Photoshop document as a PSD file for future editing or as a JPG or PNG file for sharing or printing. You can also use your Burn Book font to create your own Burn Book cover, logo, invitation, sticker, tumbler wrap or any other project you can think of.
 
Congratulations! You have learned how to create a Mean Girls Burn Book font in Photoshop using some simple steps and resources. Have fun with your new font and remember: don't write anything too mean!
